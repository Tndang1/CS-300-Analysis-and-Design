# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

##What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course I was exploring different data structures and their pros and cons.
In this particular project the goal was to determine which structure would be best for displaying and searching an ordered list.
##How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first considered what the intent of the program and the requirements.
By learning what each data structure was good and bad at, I could compare the needs of the program to the different data structures and determine which structure or structures would be best suited.
##How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I made sure to work on small sections at a time, so when I encountered an issue I would know where to start.
When blockers arose I was able to overcome them by reviewing examples of the data structure I was working with being implemented.
##How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
While I had been aware of data structures, I had not worked with them before. 
Having now implemented several I am aware of how much performance difference can result from using the right structure for a program.
##How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
First by using in code comments, I can ensure my own past codes are good references for future projects, and that should I or someone else come back to a project they can understand what the code is doing.
For some data structures and functions, I might be better served by creating a seperate class to handle the implementation, which would allow me to reuse more of the code.
